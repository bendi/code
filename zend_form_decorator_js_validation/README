Zend framework decorator for enabling pure client-side validation.

This class WILL:
- add client side validators for each server-side validator
- add onsubmit handler to form in order to perform client-side validation

This class WILL NOT:
- require external JS libraries
- you just need to copy Zend.Form.Validator.js into your script directory

Options:
- validateAll (boolean / false) - set this to true if you want to run all
validation rules at once and display all messages, otherwise rules will be called one
at a time thus forcing user to revalidate after entering corrected values
default: false

- scriptDir (string / /js/) - points to the location of your script
directory
default: /js/
